This is probably the simplest executable you'll ever see. Just copy the files in the format `samples-x.zip`, where `x` is the **name of problem**, into the `tc` folder, and then run the `domjudge.py` [file](./tc/domjudge.py).

This program will extract the **zip files**, give the folder a shortened name, and then delete the zip file.
